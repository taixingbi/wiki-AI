### Latency 
delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it
  * The Speed of Light on a Computer Network (e.g. fiber at least 7.5 ms to travel 1,000 miles)    
  * Typical Internet Connection Latencies      
    1 Fiber optic: 18 ms     
    2 Cable internet: 26 ms     
    3 DSL: 44 ms      
    4 Satellite internet: 638 ms   
    
  * Causes of Lag on Internet Connections   
    1 internet traffic load. it varies by service provider and a person's geographic location     
    2 Online application load. e.g. Multiplayer online games     
    3 Weather and other wireless interference e.g. Satellite    
    4 Lag switche e.g. online game
    
   * Causes of Lag on Home Networks   
    1 Overloaded router or modem     
    2 Overloaded client device     
    3 Malware     
    4 Use of wireless(wifi)
