#### Bandwidth 
commonly measured in bits/second is the maximum rate that information can be transferred    

#### Throughput 
is the actual rate that information is transferred    

#### Latency 
the delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it, this is mainly a function of the signals travel time, and processing time at any nodes the information traverses    

#### Jitter 
variation in packet delay at the receiver of the information    

#### Error 
rate the number of corrupted bits expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total sent
