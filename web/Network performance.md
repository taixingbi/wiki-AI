### Latency 
delay between the sender and the receiver decoding it
  * The Speed of Light on a Computer Network (e.g. fiber at least 7.5 ms to travel 1,000 miles)    
  * Typical Internet Connection Latencies      
    * Fiber optic: 18 ms     
    * Cable internet: 26 ms     
    * DSL: 44 ms      
    * Satellite internet: 638 ms   
    
  * Causes of Lag on Internet Connections   
    * internet traffic load. it varies by service provider and a person's geographic location     
    * Online application load. e.g. Multiplayer online games     
    * Weather and other wireless interference e.g. Satellite    
    * Lag switche e.g. online game
    
  * Causes of Lag on Home Networks   
    * Overloaded router or modem     
    * Overloaded client device     
    * Malware     
    * Use of wireless(wifi)
