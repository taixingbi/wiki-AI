### Definition
Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer   

When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.     

Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":    
  * When a user visits a web page, his **name** can be stored in a cookie.    
  * Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his **name**.

### Security concerns
Only the website that creates a cookie can read it, so other servers do not have access to your information.
